# BGSView
Dashboard for the Baltimore Green Space non profit organization for facilitating key discussion points and metrics in regular board meetings, planning and strategy sessions.


## Use
The dashboard can be accessed [**here**](https://bgs-dashboard.herokuapp.com/).  It allows staff or board members who have the structured reports and files to upload each file to view an interactive chart to communicate status in each key area: fundraising, pledge activity, budget, grant activity and strategic plan activity.

To ensure consistency and continuity in reporting and data collection and management, files for which column headers have been altered or new tracking statuses have been added will not render in the dashboard.

Users can upload reports from any period or quarter and can save individual charts as png files for use in reports, presentations or broader distribution.


## Prerequisites
Outside of having access to the organization's data, there are no package installations or system requirements associated with using the dashboard.  A working brower and internet connection will do the trick.


To-do
- [X] add file upload component
- [ ] remove color from chart div borders
